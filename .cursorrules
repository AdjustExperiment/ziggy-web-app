# Vibecoder-friendly agent rules (compatibility file)
#
# If you use an AI agent in this repo, it should:
# - Keep PRs small and incremental
# - Avoid committing secrets (.env, keys)
# - Preserve existing Supabase structure; use staging first
# - Ensure `npm run lint`, `npm test -- --run`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build` are passing
#
# Prompts to ask yourself:
# - What is the acceptance criteria?
# - What could break?
# - How can we validate quickly (tests/types)?
