description: Vibecoder workflow rules for safe, low-friction changes (Cursor + agents).
---

## Goal
Ship features with minimal friction while keeping production safe.

## Default workflow (prompt → preview → production)
- Work on a branch (`feat/...`, `fix/...`, `chore/...`)
- Run local checks: `lint`, `test`, `typecheck`, `build`
- Push branch → open PR → Vercel Preview URL appears
- Merge PR → Vercel Production deploys from `main`

## Vibecoder prompts (ask before coding)
- What is the acceptance criteria?
- What could break (auth, payments, permissions, migrations)?
- What is the smallest PR that accomplishes it?
- What checks should be added/updated (tests, types)?

## Change rules
- Prefer small PRs (reviewable in < 15 minutes).
- Do not introduce new secrets into the repo.
- If touching Supabase:
  - Never test destructive changes against production
  - Ensure migrations are additive/safe, include rollback notes in PR
  - Prefer staging first (Preview/branch env)

## Release checklist (agent must confirm)
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test -- --run`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run build`
